        <p>The Fundamental Rights in India enshrined in part III (Article 12–35) of the Constitution of India guarantee
            civil liberties such that all Indians can lead their lives in peace and harmony as citizens of India.
            These rights are known as "fundamental" as they are the most essential for all-round development i.e.,
            material, intellectual, moral and spiritual and protected by fundamental law of the land i.e. constitution.
            These include individual rights common to most liberal democracies, such as equality before law, freedom of
            speech and expression, freedom of association and peaceful assembly, freedom to practice religion and
            the right to constitutional remedies for the protection of civil rights by means of writs such as habeas
            corpus. Violations of these rights result in punishments as prescribed in the Indian Penal Code, subject
            to discretion of the judiciary. The Fundamental Rights are defined as basic human freedoms where every
            Indian citizen has the right to enjoy for a proper and harmonious development of personality and life.
            These rights apply universally to all citizens of India, irrespective of their race, place of birth,
            religion, caste or gender.

        <p id="heading"><em>The six fundamental rights are:</em></p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <p>1.Right to equality (Article 14–18)</p>
        <p>The right to equality is one of the important fundamental rights of the Indian Constitution that guarantees
            equal rights for everyone, irrespective of religion, gender, caste, race or place of birth.
            It ensures equal employment opportunities in the government and insures against discrimination by the State
            in matters of employment on the basis of caste, religion, etc. This right also includes the abolition of
            titles as well as untouchability.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <p>2.Right to freedom (Article 19–22)</p>
        <p>Freedom is one of the most important ideals cherished by any democratic society. The Indian Constitution
            guarantees freedom to citizens. The freedom right includes many rights such as:</p>

        <p> Freedom of speech
            Freedom of expression
            Freedom of assembly without arms
            Freedom of association
            Freedom to practise any profession
            Freedom to reside in any part of the country</p>
        <p>Some of these rights are subject to certain conditions of state security, public morality and decency and
            friendly relations with foreign countries. This means that the State has the right to impose reasonable
            restrictions on them.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <p>3.Right against exploitation (Article 23–24)</p>
        <p>This right implies the prohibition of traffic in human beings, begar, and other forms of forced labour. It
            also implies the prohibition of employment of children in factories, etc. The Constitution prohibits the
            employment of children under 14 years in hazardous conditions.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <p>4.Right to freedom of religion (Article 25–28)</p>
        <p>This indicates the secular nature of Indian polity. There is equal respect given to all religions. There is
            freedom of conscience, profession, practice and propagation of religion. The State has no official religion.
            Every person has the right to freely practice his or her faith, and establish and maintain religious and
            charitable institutions.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <p>5.Cultural and educational rights (Article 29–30)</p>
        <p>These rights protect the rights of religious, cultural and linguistic minorities, by facilitating them to
            preserve their heritage and culture. Educational rights are for ensuring education for everyone without any
            discrimination.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <p>6.Right to constitutional remedies (Article 32–35)</p>
        <p>The Constitution guarantees remedies if citizens’ fundamental rights are violated. The government cannot
            infringe upon or curb anyone’s rights. When these rights are violated, the aggrieved party can approach the
            courts. Citizens can even go directly to the Supreme Court which can issue writs for enforcing fundamental
            rights.</p>
